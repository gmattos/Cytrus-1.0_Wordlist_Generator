# Cytrus_The_Best_Keyword_Wordlist_Generator
A smart python script which creates dumb passwords WordList by social keywords.

If you watched the first season of Mr Robot you know what I mean LOL. 

My script receives keywords and creates all possible iterations between them, but setting any length limit without lost characters resulted from slice processing.

After this, these combinatios are triplicated of yours uppercased, lowercased and titled variations.  

Parameters model: [minimum passwords size] [maximum passwords size] [n-strings...] 

Example:
                                         :~$ sudo python3 Cytrus.py 8 14 car 18 02 pythonic kali pwnd

I limited the maximum passwords size possibility to 24, by security purposes on my tests, be welcome to change this or every else.

If you enjoyed my code, spare a change for a pint =)
