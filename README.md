# MR_RBT_PW_Gen
A simple python script which creates dumb passwords WordList by keywords.

If you watched the first season of Mr Robot you know what I mean LOL. 

My script receives keywords and creates all possible iterations between them, but with a length limit and without lost characters resulted from slice() processing.

After this, these combinatios are triplicated of yours uppercased, lowercased and titled variations.  

Parameters model: [maximum passwords size] [n-strings...] 

Example:                                :~$ sudo python3 8 14 car 18 02 pythonic kali pwnd

I limited the maximum passwords size possibility to 24, by security purposes on my testing time, be welcome to change this or every else.

If you enjoyed my code, spare a change for a pint =)
